    "Delimiter Pattern": "Please summarise the following text 'There is a growing interest in understanding the role of genetics in explaining heterogeneity in behaviors, including those related to information systems (IS). The majority of the recent genetics research focuses on searching the entire genome in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to link DNA to human traits. The results of GWASs can be used on datasets to compute a measure of genetic propensity known as a polygenic score, or PGS. PGSs are widely viewed as the future of genetics research. We conducted an exploratory study, in the context of information technology (IT) use, to examine if the PGS approach can be used to better understand the role of genetics in IS research. Consistent with our hypotheses, genetic endowments associated with Educational Attainment and General Cognition positively predict technology use, and genetic endowments associated with Neuroticism, Depressive Symptoms, Myocardial Infarction, and Coronary Artery Disease negatively predict technology use more than half a century later (genetic endowments are established at conception and our sample consists of individuals aged 50 to 80). Many of the characteristics known to be associated with heterogeneity in IT use (e.g., trust, education) appear to be mediators linking PGSs to IT use. Nonetheless, a number of PGSs maintain meaningful direct effects.'",

    Loaded_Language - Uses specific phrases and words that carry strong emotional impact to affect the audience, e.g. 'a lone lawmaker‚Äôs childish shouting.'
    Exaggeration,Minimisation - Either representing something in an excessive manner or making something seem less important than it actually is, e.g. 'I was not fighting with her; we were just playing.'
    Appeal_to_Authority - Supposes that a claim is true because a valid authority or expert on the issue supports it, 'The World Health Organisation stated, the new medicine is the most effective treatment for the disease.'
    Slogans - A brief and striking phrase that contains labeling and stereotyping, e.g.  ‚ÄúMake America great again!‚Äù
    Doubt - Questioning the credibility of someone or something, e.g. 'Is he ready to be the Mayor?
